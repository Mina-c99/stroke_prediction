# stroke_prediction with R

Creating a well-validated stroke prediction model for clinical application based on patient characteristics involves loading, cleaning, processing, analyzing, and visualizing the data. Following these steps, I will construct and deploy a prediction model using the refined dataset. The project utilizes a dataset containing 11 clinical features for the prediction of stroke events.
